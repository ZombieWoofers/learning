This is a repo I created to store investigations into algorithms and some fundamentals of computer science. Mainly practicing implementations in Swift but some other tid bits as well.

Many files were impleneted using the very concise and excellent examples in Swift Algorithms by Wayne Bishop, so go support him and buy a copy!
